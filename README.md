# Unity DAURAR (Dual-Arm-Univeral-Robot5-Augmented-Reality)

### This repo is the Unity component for the DAURAR project for the Dual-Arm UR5 manipulators in the MuLIP lab at Tufts University.

I didn't have enough git lfs storage for the vuforia *.tgz file.
Used USB drive to manually transfered file and added file type to gitignore file.
